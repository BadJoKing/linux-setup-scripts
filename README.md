# linux-setup-scripts
Made this thing so I wouldn't have to type everything by hand. Made this public because I couldn't be arsed to log into my github every time I install another linux distro.
Also don't @ me if the code is about as terryble as this pun just now. I know and I have no intention to fix it.

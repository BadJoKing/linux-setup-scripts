# linux-setup-scripts
Made this thing so I wouldn't have to type everything by hand. Made this public because I couldn't be arsed to log into my github every time I install another linux distro. I am not in any way responsible if any of the packages installed by the script(s) in here break your machine. It was your choice trusting a random install script written by a 16-year-old to just know what's right.
Also don't @ me if the code is about as terryble as this pun just now. I know and I have no intention to fix it.
## If you're running...
* ...mint, Pop!_OS or any other Ubuntu based distro you can just use the script from the mint folder. Just remember to set its permissions so that it can be run as administrator
* ...manjaro the setup_manjaro.sh file might work. Might also not, I don't care.
